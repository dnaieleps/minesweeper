# minesweeper 
recreated minesweeper from scratch using the Java Swing and AWT library with adjustable dimensions and mine % within the playable board. included the use of core concepts such as Object Oriented Programming (OOP), recursion, array manipulation, etc. 100% will expand this project in the future by developing a program that can solve the puzzle in a reasonable amount of time. all files needed for running are included in this repo so feel free to try it out :p
